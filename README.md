## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `build/`: The output folder containing the React application files.
- `codebuild/`: AWS CodeBuild configuration file.
  - `.codebuild.yaml`
- `README.md`: This README file.
   
## Key Features
- Automates the build and deployment of an React application to an S3 bucket.
- Uses AWS CodePipeline for setting up a CICD pipeline.
- Demonstrates integration with AWS CodeBuild for building the React app.
- Enables a static website hosted on an S3 bucket.

## Technologies Used
- React: Frontend framework
- AWS S3: Object storage service for hosting the website
- AWS CodePipeline: CICD service for automating the deployment process
- AWS CodeBuild: Service for building the React application
- Git: Version control system
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for React development


## Requirements

Before setting up the CI-CD pipeline, ensure you have the following:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- The React application codebase.
- AWS CLI configured with the necessary credentials.
- Git installed on your local machine.


## How the Task Is Made

Follow the AWS documentation and the screenshots provided in the "Screenshots" section to set up the CICD pipeline.
The CICD pipeline automates the following steps:
- Create an S3 bucket to host the React application.
- Build the React application using npm run build.
- Upload the application files to the S3 bucket.
- Configure the bucket for static website hosting.
- Set up an AWS CodePipeline with source, build, and deploy stages.
